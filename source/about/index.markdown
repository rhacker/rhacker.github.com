**About me**

I was a PC breaker, addicted gamer and a baby boy who always wanted his mother.

I am a generalist engineer, a creator, code breaker.

I will be an entrepreneur, a motorbike breaker, or just a happy man.

I have passion in learning and crafting and talking things. In my free time, I want to spend times hanging out with loved ones, always with the camera on my hand [to capture moments](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nxqd/)  in my point of view. I belong to nowhere, I love traveling, being freedom and enjoy reading books on the way.

A bottle of water - seriously I drink a lot. On the software side: Vim (I do write everything in Vim), for RSS Reader I use <a href="http://www.feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a> and I have no special need for reading PDF files other than the default one on Mac OSX. And sure, Terminal where I do most of developing works.

**What's your workspace like?**

At work: We have a good adjustable desk, so it's pretty comfortable if I want to stand. I'm always with a couple of waters and I have my headphone on when I want to concentrate on difficultt tasks.

Anywhere else: I put important files on Dropbox, docs on Google Docs and dotFiles on Github if I really need it. And sure I work with my Macbook.
